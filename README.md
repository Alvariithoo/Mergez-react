# Mergez  
Protocol 6 Agar.io client for private servers

### Getting support | Discord server
If you need extra help with anything you should ask it in the [Agar.io Private Servers Discord](https://discord.gg/CfvdZZrCKE) and not in issues.

### Why Mergez?
This is the source code of Mergez that was firstly inspired in private server with customs modes, then based in my first version of  [Cigar2](https://github.com/Alvariithoo/Cigar2) using webgl with [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) later moving to [React](https://react.dev/) with multiple files and modular like LituDev's version of [Cigar3](https://github.com/LituDev/Cigar3)
